A series of inference works that take into account data and model uncertainty using bayesian methods on :

 1. Object detection on Earth observing satellite images (methods : bayesian neural network)
 2. Stellar object classification on astronomical images (methods : comparison between classic SVM and bayesian neural network)
 3. Can time series data be analyzed using a bayesian framework?
